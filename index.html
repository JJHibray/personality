    <h2>ENFP-A "The Campaigner"</h2>

    <p>The Campaigner personality is a true free spirit.
        They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in
        the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in
        the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they
        are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they
        make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and
        compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise
        can certainly be felt in any crowd.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for –
            and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how
            old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool – for love – for your dreams
            – for the adventure of being alive.

        <ul>
            <li>They believe that everyone should take the time to recognize
                and express their feelings, and their empathy and sociability
                make that a natural conversation topic.</li>
            <li>Campaigners are very emotional and sensitive, and when they step on someone’s toes,
                they both feel it.</li>
            <li>Campaigners will spend a lot of time exploring social relationships, feelings and
                ideas before they find something that really rings true.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Strengths & Weaknesses</h1>
        <ul>
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <li><b>Observant</b> – Campaigners believe that there are no irrelevant actions, that every shift in
                sentiment,
                every move and every idea is part of something bigger. To satisfy their curiosity, Campaigners try
                to notice all of these things, and to never miss a moment.</li>
            <li><b>Excellent Communicators</b> – It’s a good thing that Campaigners have such strong people skills, or
                they’d
                never express these ideas. Campaigners enjoy both small talk and deep, meaningful conversations, which
                are just two sides of the same coin for them, and are adept at steering conversations towards their
                desired subjects in ways that feel completely natural and unforced.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h2>Weakness</h2>
            <li><b>Find it Difficult to Focus</b> – Campaigners are natural explorers of interpersonal connections and
                philosophy, but this backfires when what needs to be done is that TPS report sitting right in
                front of them. It’s hard for Campaigners to maintain interest as tasks drift towards routine,
                administrative matters, and away from broader concepts.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="flex">
        <h1>Friendships</h1>
        <p>As with other relationships, Campaigners view their friendships as opportunities to experience another angle
            of the universe, and tend to imbue potential friendships with that weighty and idealistic quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More outgoing types will naturally gravitate towards them, but Campaigners will also go to great
                lengths and be surprisingly persistent in their efforts to get to know more reserved personalities.</li>
            <li>Campaigners are open-minded and sincere enough in their friendships, and connect with and understand
                even their acquaintances well enough, that they recognize that not everyone expresses themselves in the
                same ways, and that that’s okay.</li>
            <li>Campaigner personalities tend to give much more of themselves than most are even capable of giving
                back.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="flex">
        <h1>Parents</h1>
        <p>Campaigners will embrace and encourage productive interests as they arise, sweeping away dolls and dinosaurs
            when interests shift to the oceans, and sweeping away the fish when tastes change again, to the stars.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Campaigner parents are playful and warm, and love to see their children excited, playing in and
                experimenting with the world around them.</li>
            <li>Campaigner parents want to share in their children’s perspective, share in a world without bounds.</li>
            <li> While they may not be big on using proven ideas, Campaigners do like to see whether or not their ideas
                work, and this applies to their thoughts on parenting, too.</li>
        </ul>

    <article class="flex">
        <h1>Career Paths</h1>
        <p>If there’s a challenge Campaigners face when selecting a career, it isn’t that they lack talent or options
            or drive, it’s that there are so many things out there that are just cool.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Much of modern progress stems from incorporating other studies into typically disassociated fields, and
                no one is better equipped to merge broad interests than talented, energetic and future-minded
                Campaigners.</li>
            <li>Where Campaigners do not shine is in systems of strict regimentation and hierarchy, such as military
                service. Campaigners thrive on the ability to question the status quo and explore the alternatives, and
                if this is a quality that is not just unappreciated but actually frowned upon, this will not only make
                them unhappy, but it may even threaten their emotional stability. </li>
            <li>Repetition, predictability, boredom… while some Sentinel types may appreciate predictability and clear
                hierarchies, these are not selling points for Campaigners.</li>
        </ul>

    <article class="flex">
        <h1>Workplace Habits</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Campaigners are growth-oriented, and as subordinates they’ll impress their managers with their
                creativity and adaptability.</li>
            <li> People with the Campaigner personality type are excellent listeners, able to analyze and understand
                others’ perspectives effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Campaigners are people-people, and as far as the workplace is concerned, this quality shows through
                best among colleagues. More than just coworkers, Campaigners view their colleagues as friends, people
                who they take a genuine interest in, providing support and cheer when they’re down or stressed. People
                with the Campaigner personality type are warm and optimistic, always searching for and usually finding
                win-win situations for everyone.</li>
        </ul>
